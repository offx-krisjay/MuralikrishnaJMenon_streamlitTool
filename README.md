  - Correlations
  - Missing value insights
  - Warnings and suggestions
- Supports **Polars** dataframes by converting to Pandas (`.to_pandas()`).

### 3. Interactive UI
- Built with **Streamlit** widgets:
  - File upload
  - Operation selection
  - Live previews of data
  - Download cleaned CSV
- Designed to handle large datasets gracefully.

### 4. ML Prediction Module (Add-on)
- Users can upload/train a simple ML model or load a pre-trained one.
- Input values via the UI to get predictions:
  - Classification of uploaded rows
  - Predictions for user-provided values

### 5. Deployment
